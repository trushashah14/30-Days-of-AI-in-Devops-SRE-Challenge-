## 📝 Step 1: Introduction & Planning

### 🎯 Overview
Manual incident analysis is slow and often misses key deviations. This workflow uses ML simulation and LLMs to reconstruct expected system behavior, compare it to actual metrics, and generate actionable replay narratives.

### 🗺️ Planning
- **Goal:** Reconstruct incident timelines and pinpoint deviations using ML and LLMs.
- **Inputs:** Incident metadata, historical baselines, actual incident metrics.
- **Process:** 
  - Simulate expected system behavior using ML models.
  - Compare actual vs. simulated metrics to find deviation zones.
  - Generate a replay narrative using LLM.
- **Outputs:** 
  - Replay narrative, deviation analysis, and actionable insights.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Improves postmortem accuracy and team learning.
  - Standardizes incident documentation.
  - Surfaces hidden reliability gaps.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Environment Setup

### 💻 Implementation

**How to set up your environment:**
- Install Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn requests
  ```
- Prepare sample data files:
  - `incident_metadata.csv`, `historical_baseline.csv`, `actual_metrics.csv`

**What did I get?**
- Python environment ready for simulation, analysis, and LLM integration
- Sample and/or real incident data for analysis

## 📄 Step 3: Data Preparation

### 🎯 Overview
Incident metadata, historical baselines, and actual metrics are the input for simulation and replay.

**How to get real data:**
- **Incident Metadata:**  
  Export timestamps, affected services, and expected SLAs from monitoring or ticketing systems.
- **Historical Baseline:**  
  Export normal system metrics from monitoring tools.
- **Actual Metrics:**  
  Export metrics during the incident window.

- Ensure each CSV has columns:  
  - `incident_metadata.csv`: `timestamp`, `service`, `expected_sla`
  - `historical_baseline.csv`: `timestamp`, `service`, `metric`, `value`
  - `actual_metrics.csv`: `timestamp`, `service`, `metric`, `value`

- Place these files in the project folder for notebook analysis.

**Why this format?**
- CSV is easy to parse and structure for ML simulation and deviation analysis
- Supports multiple services and metrics

**What did I get?**
- Structured input data for the workflow

## 🤖 Step 4: ML Simulation & Deviation Analysis

### 💻 Implementation

- Load incident, baseline, and actual metrics into pandas DataFrames.
- Train ML models (e.g., regression, time-series) on historical baseline to simulate expected metrics for the incident window.
- Compare actual vs. simulated metrics to identify deviation zones and root causes.

**Why this approach?**
- ML simulation provides objective, data-driven baseline for expected behavior.
- Deviation analysis pinpoints reliability gaps and root causes.

**What did I get?**
- Table of deviation zones and affected metrics

## 🧠 Step 5: LLM Replay Narrative Generation

### 💻 Implementation

- Format a prompt summarizing incident timeline, deviations, and affected services.
- Send prompt to LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) to generate a replay narrative:
  ```
  “At 14:03, Service B should have autoscaled to 6 pods. Instead, it stalled at 2, causing cascading latency in Service C.”
  ```
- Display replay narrative in Markdown for easy review.

**Why this approach?**
- LLM transforms technical deviation data into actionable, stakeholder-friendly incident documentation.

**What did I get?**
- Human-friendly replay narrative and deviation analysis for postmortems

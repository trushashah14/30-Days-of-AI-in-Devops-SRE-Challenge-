# Day 29: AI-Generated “What If” Reliability Scenarios 🧪⚡ – Sept 5, 2025

## Challenge Description 🎯
Explore hypothetical reliability scenarios to stress-test your architecture and team readiness using AI-driven scenario generation and LLM-powered narratives.

## Objective 🚀
- Use historical incident data and service topology to train a scenario generator (probabilistic model or GAN)
- Prompt an LLM to create “What if…” reliability narratives
- Output predicted impact, mitigation strategies, and team response checklist

## Code & Implementation 💻
- **Notebook**: `what_if_scenarios.ipynb`  
  Main workflow for data loading, scenario generation, LLM narrative creation, and output formatting.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: `Step-by-Step-Solution.md`  
  Detailed guide for setup, workflow, and interpretation.
- **Sample Data**:  
  - `incidents.csv` – historical incident data
  - `topology.csv` – service topology/architecture
- **Output**:  
  - “What if…” scenario narratives, impact predictions, mitigation strategies, and team checklists

## Workflow 🔄
1. **Prepare Data:**  
   Collect historical incident and service topology data.
2. **Scenario Generation:**  
   Use probabilistic modeling or GANs to generate hypothetical reliability scenarios.
3. **LLM Narrative Creation:**  
   Prompt LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) to generate “What if…” narratives, impact analysis, and mitigation steps.
4. **Report:**  
   Output scenario narratives and checklists for review and tabletop exercises.

## Why Each Step Was Chosen 📊
- **Scenario Generation:**  
  Enables proactive reliability testing and team readiness.
- **LLM Narratives:**  
  Provides actionable, stakeholder-friendly scenario documentation.

## Usage

Open and run `what_if_scenarios.ipynb` in Jupyter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `requests` (for LLM API)

## Interpretation of Results 🧠
- **Scenario Narratives:**  
  “What if the CDN fails during a product launch?”
  “What if the DB hits max connections during Black Friday?”
- **Mitigation & Checklist:**  
  Actionable steps and team response plans.

## How to Use in Real-World DevOps/SRE 🌍

### Proactive Reliability Scenario Planning
**Use Case:**  
Stress-test architecture and team response with realistic “What if…” scenarios.

**Implementation:**  
- Integrate notebook into reliability reviews and tabletop exercises
- Use output for incident simulations and training

**Industry Examples:**  
- CDN failure during major events
- Database overload during peak sales

## Where Was AI Used? 🤖

- **AI Usage:**  
  - Probabilistic scenario generation: Uses historical incident and topology data, random sampling, and templates to create realistic "What if..." reliability scenarios.
  - LLM-driven documentation: Ollama Llama 3 generates stakeholder-friendly scenario narratives, predicted impact, mitigation strategies, and team response checklists from structured scenario metadata.

**AI Technologies Utilized:**  
- Python (pandas for data fusion, numpy for sampling, scenario modeling logic)
- Ollama/OpenAI (LLM for scenario documentation and checklist generation via API calls in the notebook)

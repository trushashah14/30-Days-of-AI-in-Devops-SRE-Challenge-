# 📋 Step-by-step Solution – Day 29: AI-Generated “What If” Reliability Scenarios

---

## 📝 Step 1: Introduction & Planning

### 🎯 Overview
Manual scenario planning is slow and limited. This workflow uses probabilistic modeling or GANs and LLMs to automate “What if…” reliability scenario generation and team readiness documentation.

### 🗺️ Planning
- **Goal:** Proactively stress-test architecture and team response using AI-generated scenarios.
- **Inputs:** Historical incident data and service topology.
- **Process:** 
  - Train scenario generator (probabilistic model or GAN) on incident/topology data.
  - Generate hypothetical “What if…” scenarios.
  - Use LLM to create narratives, impact analysis, mitigation strategies, and team checklists.
- **Outputs:** 
  - Scenario narratives, impact predictions, mitigation steps, and response checklists.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Scales to many services and failure modes.
  - Improves team readiness and incident response.
  - Standardizes scenario documentation for tabletop exercises.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Environment Setup

### 💻 Implementation

**How to set up your environment:**
- Install Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn requests
  ```
- Prepare sample data files:
  - `incidents.csv`, `topology.csv`

**What did I get?**
- Python environment ready for scenario modeling and LLM integration
- Sample and/or real incident/topology data for analysis

## 📄 Step 3: Data Preparation

### 🎯 Overview
Incident and topology data are the input for scenario generation. Place them in CSV files.

**How to get real data:**
- **Incidents:**  
  Export historical incident records from monitoring or ticketing systems.
- **Topology:**  
  Export service architecture from documentation or monitoring tools.

- Ensure each CSV has columns:  
  - `incidents.csv`: `date`, `service`, `type`, `impact`, `mitigation`
  - `topology.csv`: `service`, `dependencies`, `criticality`

- Place these files in the project folder for notebook analysis.

**Why this format?**
- CSV is easy to parse and structure for scenario modeling
- Supports multiple incident and topology attributes

**What did I get?**
- Structured input data for the workflow

## 🤖 Step 4: Scenario Generation (Probabilistic Model or GAN)

### 💻 Implementation

- Load incident and topology data into pandas DataFrames.
- Use probabilistic modeling (e.g., Markov chains) or GANs to generate hypothetical “What if…” scenarios.
- Select scenarios with high impact or critical dependencies.

**Why this approach?**
- AI-generated scenarios cover more failure modes than manual brainstorming.
- Enables proactive reliability testing.

**What did I get?**
- List of hypothetical “What if…” scenarios for review

---

## 🧠 Step 5: LLM Narrative & Checklist Generation

### 💻 Implementation

- For each scenario, format a prompt summarizing the situation, predicted impact, and dependencies.
- Send prompt to LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) to generate:
  - Scenario narrative (“What if the CDN fails during a product launch?”)
  - Predicted impact
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Team response checklist
- Display output in Markdown for easy review.

**Why this approach?**
- LLM transforms scenario metadata into actionable, stakeholder-friendly documentation.
- Saves manual effort and standardizes scenario format.

**What did I get?**
- Human-friendly scenario narratives and checklists for tabletop exercises

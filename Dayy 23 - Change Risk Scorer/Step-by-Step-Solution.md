# Day 23: Change Risk Scorer â€“ Step-by-Step Solution

---

## Step 1: Introduction & Planning

**Why:**  
Manual risk review of changes is slow and subjective. Automating risk scoring with ML and AI explanations speeds up change management and improves reliability.

**How:**  
A markdown cell outlines the workflow: generate features, train model, predict risk, explain, visualize, and export.

**What did I get:**  
A clear roadmap for automated change risk scoring.

---

## Step 2: Feature Generation

**Why:**  
Risk scoring depends on change size, coverage, and deployment history.

**How:**  
- Simulate PR diff (lines/files changed), coverage, and deployment history.
- Assign risk labels using simple rules.

**What did I get:**  
Synthetic dataset for model training and testing.

---

## Step 3: Data Loading & Merging

**Why:**  
Combining all features enables accurate risk prediction.

**How:**  
- Load CSVs for PR diff, coverage, and deployment history.
- Merge on PR ID.

**What did I get:**  
Unified feature table for each change.

---

## Step 4: Model Training

**Why:**  
ML classifier learns risk patterns from historical data.

**How:**  
- Train RandomForest on features and risk labels.
- Encode labels for classification.

**What did I get:**  
Trained risk scoring model.

## Step 5: Prediction & Explanation

**Why:**  
Automated risk scoring and clear reasoning are needed for actionable review.

**How:**  
- Predict risk and confidence for each change.
- Generate explanations using rule-based or LLM explainer.

**What did I get:**  
Risk scores and explanations for all changes.

---

## Step 6: Visualization

**Why:**  
Visuals help reviewers spot risky changes and understand distribution.

**How:**  
- Histogram of high-risk confidence scores.
- Styled HTML/PDF table with color-coded risk.

**What did I get:**  
Clear, actionable visual reports.

---

## Step 7: Export Results

**Why:**  
Save results for review, reporting, and audit.

**How:**  
- Export CSV, HTML, and PDF files.
- Include explanations for each change.

**What did I get:**  
Ready-to-use risk review artifacts.

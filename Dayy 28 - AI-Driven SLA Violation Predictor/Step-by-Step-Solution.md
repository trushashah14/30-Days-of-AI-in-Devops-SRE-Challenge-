# 📋 Step-by-step Solution – Day 28: AI-Driven SLA Violation Predictor

---

## 📝 Step 1: Introduction & Planning

### 🎯 Overview
Manual SLA risk detection is slow and reactive. This workflow uses time-series forecasting (Prophet) and LLMs to proactively predict SLA violations, generate actionable risk reports, and validate LLM output.

### 🗺️ Planning
- **Goal:** Forecast and mitigate SLA breaches before they occur, with validated risk reports.
- **Inputs:** Historical uptime, latency, and error rate metrics.
- **Process:** 
  - Train time-series models (Prophet) to forecast metrics for the next 7 days.
  - Flag days with high risk of SLA violation using confidence intervals.
  - Generate a stakeholder-friendly risk report using LLM.
  - Validate LLM output against forecast logic.
- **Outputs:** 
  - SLA risk predictions, mitigation report, and validation results.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Enables proactive incident prevention.
  - Standardizes risk reporting for SREs and stakeholders.
  - Ensures reliability of LLM-generated documentation.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Environment Setup

### 💻 Implementation

**How to set up your environment:**
- Install Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas prophet matplotlib requests
  ```
- Prepare sample data file:
  - `sla_metrics.csv` (historical uptime, latency, error rates)

**What did I get?**
- Python environment ready for forecasting, visualization, LLM integration, and validation
- Sample and/or real SLA metrics for analysis

## 📄 Step 3: Data Preparation

### 🎯 Overview
SLA metrics are the input for risk prediction. Place them in a CSV file.

**How to get real data:**
- Export uptime, latency, and error rate metrics from monitoring tools (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- Ensure CSV has columns: `date`, `uptime`, `latency`, `error_rate`

**Why this format?**
- CSV is easy to parse and structure for time-series analysis
- Supports multiple SLA metrics

**What did I get?**
- Structured input data for the workflow

## 📈 Step 4: Time-Series Forecasting & SLA Risk Prediction

### 💻 Implementation

- Load historical metrics into pandas DataFrame.
- Use Prophet to forecast metrics for the next 7 days.
- Flag days where predicted metrics breach SLA thresholds using forecast confidence intervals.
- Assign severity levels (Low, Moderate, High) based on number of violations.

**Why this approach?**
- Time-series models provide robust, explainable forecasts.
- Confidence intervals improve risk identification.
- Severity levels help prioritize mitigation.

**What did I get?**
- Table of predicted metrics, SLA risk flags, and severity levels

## 🧠 Step 5: LLM Risk Report Generation & Validation

### 💻 Implementation

- Format a prompt summarizing predicted risks and flagged days.
- Send prompt to LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) to generate a risk report with mitigation suggestions.
- Validate LLM output against forecast logic and highlight mismatches.
- Display report and validation results in Markdown for easy review.

**Why this approach?**
- LLM transforms structured risk data into actionable, stakeholder-friendly documentation.
- Validation ensures reliability and trust in LLM output.

**What did I get?**
- Human-friendly SLA risk report with mitigation advice and validation results

# Day 28: AI-Driven SLA Violation Predictor 📉🛡️ – Sept 4, 2025

## Challenge Description 🎯
Forecast potential SLA breaches before they occur using time-series modeling and LLM-powered risk reporting.

## Objective 🚀
- Train a time-series model on historical uptime, latency, and error rates
- Predict likelihood of SLA violations in the next 7 days
- Use an LLM to generate a risk report with mitigation suggestions

## Code & Implementation 💻
- **Notebook**: `sla_violation_predictor.ipynb`  
  Main workflow for data loading, time-series modeling (Prophet), SLA risk prediction, LLM risk report generation, and validation.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: `Step-by-Step-Solution.md`  
  Detailed guide for setup, workflow, and interpretation.
- **Sample Data**:  
  - `sla_metrics.csv` – historical uptime, latency, and error rates
- **Output**:  
  - SLA risk predictions, LLM-generated risk report, and validation of LLM output against forecast logic

## Workflow 🔄
1. **Prepare Data:**  
   Collect historical SLA metrics (uptime, latency, error rates).
2. **Train Model:**  
   Use time-series forecasting (Prophet) to predict metrics for the next 7 days.
3. **Predict SLA Violations:**  
   Flag days with high risk of SLA breach using forecast confidence intervals.
4. **LLM Risk Report:**  
   Use LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) to generate a risk report with mitigation suggestions, based on structured forecast summaries.
5. **Validation:**  
   Automatically compare LLM output to forecast logic and highlight mismatches.
6. **Report:**  
   Output predictions, risk report, and validation results for review.

## Why Each Step Was Chosen 📊
- **Time-Series Modeling (Prophet):**  
  Robust, explainable forecasts with confidence intervals for risk assessment.
- **LLM Reporting:**  
  Provides actionable, stakeholder-friendly risk summaries and mitigation advice.
- **Validation Layer:**  
  Ensures LLM output matches forecast logic for reliability.

## Usage

Open and run `sla_violation_predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`, `prophet`, `matplotlib`, `requests` (for LLM API)

## Interpretation of Results 🧠
- **Risk Predictions:**  
  Shows days with high likelihood of SLA violation, including severity levels.
- **LLM Risk Report:**  
  Summarizes risks and suggests mitigation actions.
- **Validation Output:**  
  Highlights any mismatches between LLM report and forecast logic.

## How to Use in Real-World DevOps/SRE 🌍

### Proactive SLA Risk Management
**Use Case:**  
Identify and mitigate SLA risks before breaches occur, with validated risk reports.

**Implementation:**  
- Integrate notebook into weekly reviews
- Use risk report and validation for incident prevention and stakeholder communication

**Industry Examples:**  
- SLA monitoring for cloud services
- Risk reporting for managed platforms

## Where Was AI Used? 🤖

- **AI Usage:**  
  - Time-series modeling (Prophet) for SLA risk prediction
  - LLM (Ollama Llama 3) for risk report generation and mitigation suggestions
  - Automated validation of LLM output against forecast logic

**AI Technologies Utilized:**  
- Python (Prophet for forecasting, pandas for data prep, matplotlib for visualization)
- Ollama/OpenAI (LLM for risk report generation and validation)

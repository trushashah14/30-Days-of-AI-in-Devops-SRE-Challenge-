Experiment,Target,Action,Expected Outcome
DB Outage,"""db""","Simulate a temporary DB node failure by terminating the service. Verify that other services can continue to function with minimal impact (Expected outcome: Web and API services should still be available, but may experience some latency or errors).",No outcome provided
API Cache Miss,"""api""","Inject high-latency responses from cache misses to simulate a spike in API requests. Monitor the system's response time and error rates (Expected outcome: The web service should continue to function with minor errors, while the API service may experience increased latency and errors).",
Web API Timeout,"""web"" & ""api""","Simulate an intentional timeout between the web and API services by introducing a delay in their communication. Verify that both services can recover from this interruption (Expected outcome: The web service should retry requests after a short delay, while the API service should continue to process requests once the connection is re-established).",
Cache Failover,"""cache""","Simulate a temporary failure of the cache service by terminating it. Verify that other services can still function with minimal impact (Expected outcome: The web and API services should still be available, but may experience some latency or errors until the cache service is restarted).",

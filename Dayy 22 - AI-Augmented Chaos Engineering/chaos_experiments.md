Based on the system topology and past incident data, I propose the following chaos experiments to target the system's weak spots:

| Experiment | Target | Action | Expected Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DB Outage** | "db" | Simulate a temporary DB node failure by terminating the service. Verify that other services can continue to function with minimal impact (Expected outcome: Web and API services should still be available, but may experience some latency or errors). | |
| **API Cache Miss** | "api" | Inject high-latency responses from cache misses to simulate a spike in API requests. Monitor the system's response time and error rates (Expected outcome: The web service should continue to function with minor errors, while the API service may experience increased latency and errors). | 
| **Web API Timeout** | "web" & "api" | Simulate an intentional timeout between the web and API services by introducing a delay in their communication. Verify that both services can recover from this interruption (Expected outcome: The web service should retry requests after a short delay, while the API service should continue to process requests once the connection is re-established). | 
| **Cache Failover** | "cache" | Simulate a temporary failure of the cache service by terminating it. Verify that other services can still function with minimal impact (Expected outcome: The web and API services should still be available, but may experience some latency or errors until the cache service is restarted).

These chaos experiments target the system's weak spots:

* DB Outage experiment tests the system's ability to handle a primary database node failure.
* API Cache Miss experiment simulates a common issue that can cause high latency and errors in the API service.
* Web API Timeout experiment verifies the system's response to intentional timeouts between services, which can be caused by network issues or high load.
* Cache Failover experiment tests the system's ability to handle temporary failures of the cache service.

By running these chaos experiments, you'll gain valuable insights into your system's resilience and identify areas that require improvement.

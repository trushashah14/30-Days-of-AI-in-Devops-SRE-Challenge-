# 📋 Step-by-step Solution – Day 25: Performance Regression Detector

---

## 📝 Step 1: Introduction & Planning

### 🎯 Overview
Manual detection of performance regressions is slow and error-prone. This workflow uses Python (pandas, scipy) and optional ML classifiers to automate regression detection between software versions/releases for DevOps/SRE teams.

**Key Questions and Answers**

**1. Why automate regression detection?**
- Ensures reliability and performance across releases
- Avoids unnoticed degradations
- Provides objective, actionable reports

**2. Why use statistical tests and ML?**
- Statistical tests are explainable and robust for metric comparison
- ML classifiers can detect complex patterns

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Environment Setup

### 💻 Implementation

**How to set up your environment:**
- Install Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scipy scikit-learn
  ```
- Prepare benchmark files:
  - Save results as `old_benchmark.csv` and `new_benchmark.csv`

**What did I get?**
- Python environment ready for regression detection
- Benchmark data for analysis

---

## 📄 Step 3: Data Preparation

### 🎯 Overview
Benchmark metrics are the input for regression detection. Place them in CSV files.

**Why this format?**
- CSV is easy to parse and structure for statistical analysis
- Supports multiple metrics (latency, throughput, etc.)

**What did I get?**
- Structured input data for the workflow

---

## 📈 Step 4: Statistical Comparison

### 💻 Implementation

**How is comparison performed?**
- Load old and new benchmark data into pandas DataFrames
- For each metric, run a t-test between old and new values
- Calculate mean values and p-value

**Why this approach?**
- T-tests provide objective significance for changes
- Highlights metrics with significant regressions

**What did I get?**
- Table of metrics, means, p-values, and regression flags

---

## 📊 Step 5: Flag & Report Regressions

### 💻 Implementation

**How are regressions flagged and reported?**
- If the new mean is worse and p-value < 0.05, flag as regression
- Print or save a summary table with metrics, means, p-values, and regression flags

**What did I get?**
- Actionable report for SRE/DevOps teams

---

## 🧠 Step 6: ML Classifier for Regression Detection

### 💻 Implementation

**How is ML used?**
- For each metric, calculate features such as `mean_old`, `mean_new`, and their difference.
- Label each metric as regression (`1`) if the new mean is worse than the old mean, otherwise as OK (`0`).
- Train a logistic regression classifier (using scikit-learn) on these features and labels.
- Use the trained model to predict regression flags for each metric.

**Why this approach?**
- ML learns from historical benchmark data and adapts to complex, multi-metric relationships.
- Removes the need for manual threshold tuning and static rules.
- Enables scalable, automated regression detection for evolving systems.

**What did I get?**
- A dynamic, data-driven regression detection workflow powered by ML/AI.
- Clear output showing which metrics are flagged as regression or OK by the model.

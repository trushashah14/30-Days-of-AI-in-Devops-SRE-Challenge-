# Day 11: AI-Driven Ticket Triage ‚Äì Step-by-Step Solution üö¶

This guide explains how to automatically triage and tag Jira tickets using ML/NLP, and how to configure Jira for automated team assignment via components.

---

## Step 1: Introduction & Planning üìù
**Why:**  
Manual ticket triage is slow and error-prone. Automating it saves time and improves accuracy.

**How:**  
Use ML/NLP to analyze ticket summaries and descriptions, classify them into categories, and tag them with Jira components for team-based assignment.

**What did I get:**  
A clear plan for automating ticket triage and assignment using Jira components.

---

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries üß©
**Why:**  
pandas for data manipulation; requests for Jira API access; scikit-learn for ML classification.

**How:**  
```sh
pip install pandas requests scikit-learn --quiet
```

**What did I get:**  
All necessary Python libraries installed.

---

## Step 3: Prepare Historical Ticket Data for ML Training üìÑ
**Why:**  
A labeled dataset is needed to train the ML classifier.

**How:**  
- Create `ticket_history.csv` with columns: `id,summary,description,category`.
- Categories should match your Jira components: `network`, `db`, `app`.

**What did I get:**  
A training dataset for the ML model.

---

## Step 4: Train ML Model for Ticket Classification üß†
**Why:**  
ML model can automatically classify tickets into categories based on text.

**How:**  
- Use TF-IDF vectorization on summary + description.
- Train a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier** (from scikit-learn) on labeled data.
- Save training logic in `ticket_triage.py`.

**Which classifier and why:**  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** is chosen because it is simple, fast, and effective for text classification tasks where features are word counts or frequencies.
- It works well with TF-IDF features and small-to-medium datasets, making it ideal for ticket categorization based on summary and description text.

**What did I get:**  
A trained ML model that predicts ticket category.

## Step 5: Jira Component Setup & Auto-Assignment Logic üè¢

### Jira Component Setup
- ‚úÖ Created components: Network, Database, Application
- ‚úÖ Set Component Lead for each (currently me)
- ‚úÖ Set Default Assignee to Component Lead for each component

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Jira Only Auto-Assigns at Issue Creation Time
Jira checks the component‚Äôs default assignee only when the issue is created ‚Äî not when the component is updated later.

If your script updates the component after the ticket is created, Jira won‚Äôt reassign it automatically.

---

## Step 6: Jira Automation for Component-Based Assignment üîß

**Why:**  
Ensure tickets updated by your script are assigned to the correct Component Lead.

**How:**  
Set up a Jira Automation rule:
- **Trigger:** Field value changed ‚Üí Component
- **Condition:** Component is not empty
- **Action:** Assign issue ‚Üí Component Lead

This guarantees that any ticket updated by your script gets assigned properly, even after creation.

**What did I get:**  
Automated assignment to the Component Lead whenever the component is updated.

**Example Jira Automation Configuration:**

---

## Step 7: Creating Tickets Programmatically (`create_tickets.py`) üìù

**Why:**  
To test and demonstrate the triage workflow, you need sample tickets in Jira.

**How:**  
- The `create_tickets.py` script creates sample tickets in your Jira project using the REST API.
- Each ticket includes a summary, description (in Atlassian Document Format), and relevant labels.
- The script uses your Jira credentials and project key to authenticate and create issues.

**What did I get:**  
A set of realistic incident tickets in Jira, ready for triage and auto-assignment by your ML-powered workflow.

---

## Step 8: Fetch Unassigned Jira Tickets via API üîÑ
**Why:**  
Need to process only new, unassigned tickets.

**How:**  
- Use Jira REST API to search for tickets with `assignee is EMPTY AND status = 'To Do' and component is EMPTY`.
- Extract summary and description for classification.

**What did I get:**  
A DataFrame of new, unassigned Jira tickets.

---

## Step 9: ML-Based Ticket Categorization & Tagging ü§ñ
**Why:**  
Automatically tag tickets with the correct Jira component for team assignment.

**How:**  
- For each ticket, use the ML model to predict category (`network`, `db`, `app`).
- Map predicted category to Jira component (`Network`, `Database`, `Application`).
- Use Jira API to update each ticket, tagging it with the correct component.

**What did I get:**  
Tickets tagged with the right component, visible in team queues.

---

## Step 10: Script Execution üöÄ

**Why:**  
Run the full workflow to triage and tag tickets in Jira.

**How:**  
- Execute `ticket_triage.py` to fetch, classify, and tag tickets.
- Monitor logs for ticket processing and tagging status.

**What did I get:**  
A fully automated ticket triage and tagging workflow, with logs for every step.

## Step 11: Review & Iterate üîÑ
**Why:**  
Continuously improve the model and process based on feedback and performance.

**How:**  
- Review misclassified tickets and adjust the model or training data.
- Gather feedback from teams on ticket quality and triage accuracy.

**What did I get:**  
An iterative process for continuous improvement of ticket triage automation.

---

## What Did I Learn üß©
- ML can effectively classify and triage tickets, saving significant manual effort.
- Tagging tickets with Jira components enables team-based assignment and queueing.
- Integrating Python scripts with Jira API enables powerful automation workflows.
- Continuous monitoring and iteration are key to maintaining and improving automation accuracy.

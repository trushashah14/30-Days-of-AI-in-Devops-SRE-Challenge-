# Day 16: Deployment Rollback Predictor – Step-by-Step Solution 🔄

This guide explains how to predict deployment rollback risk using ML and generate actionable recommendations.

---

## Step 1: Introduction & Planning 📝
**Why:**  
Deployment rollbacks disrupt releases and impact reliability. Predicting rollback risk enables proactive mitigation.

**How:**  
Use Python and ML modeling to analyze deployment and monitoring data.

**What did I get:**  
A reproducible workflow for rollback risk prediction and reporting.

---

## Step 2: Simulate & Prepare Data 📄
**Why:**  
You need historical deployment and monitoring data for modeling.

**How:**  
- Simulate deployment data with latency, error rate, CPU, memory, and success/failure labels.
- Save as `deployment_data.csv` for reproducibility.

**What did I get:**  
Structured historical data for ML modeling.

---

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
**Why:**  
Visualize feature relationships and validate data quality.

**How:**  
- Use pairplots to show how latency, error rate, and other metrics relate to deployment outcomes.

**What did I get:**  
Clear understanding of which features correlate with rollback risk.

---

## Step 4: Preprocessing 🧼
**Why:**  
Prepare data for ML modeling.

**How:**  
- Select relevant features.
- Split data into training and historical sets.

**What did I get:**  
Cleaned and split data for model training and evaluation.

---

## Step 5: Train ML Model 🤖
**Why:**  
Learn patterns that predict rollback risk.

**How:**  
- Use Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling.
- Print best parameters and feature importances.

**What did I get:**  
A trained, optimized model and insights into which metrics matter most.

---

## Step 6: Model Evaluation on Historical Data 📈
**Why:**  
Assess model strengths and weaknesses.

**How:**  
- Show confusion matrix and classification report.
- Visualize prediction correctness with scatterplots.

**What did I get:**  
Metrics and visualizations showing where the model performs well and where it misclassifies.

---

## Step 7: Risk Prediction on New Deployments 🚦
**Why:**  
Apply the model to real-world scenarios.

**How:**  
- Score new deployments (one risky, one safe) using the trained model.
- Visualize feature comparison and risk prediction.

**What did I get:**  
Actionable risk scores and visual insights for new releases.

---

## Step 8: Interpretation & Insights 🧠
**Why:**  
Understand model outputs and limitations.

**How:**  
- Use markdown cells to explain results, feature importance, and areas for improvement.

**What did I get:**  
Stakeholder-ready explanations and guidance for future enhancements.
